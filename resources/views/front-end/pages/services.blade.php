                     Renovation tends to be cheaper than remodeling.
                     Typically, renovations are done in conjunction with restorations. For example, someone may decide they want to restore their bathrooms or kitchen. But to make it a bit more modern, they add a shower component to the tub, which would make it a renovation project as well.
